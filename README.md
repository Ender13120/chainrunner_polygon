# On-Chain Runner & Backend for https://galaxythrone.io

Automatically checks on-chain state on Polygon and triggers custom on-chain transactions depending on the state.

Also indexes & serves on-chain data for quicker UX on the game frontend

Using Nestjs + Typescript & Prisma/Docker



Outdated compared to private live version, updating it as I go from milestone to milestone
